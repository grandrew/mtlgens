UML to upwork job python API generator (C) Vrayo Systems http://vrayo.com
    This code is licensed under the AGPL v.3 or higher

    Intro
    =====
    
    This generator emits python code that uses upwork python API
    to automatically post the jobs for freelancers to write some python 
    code based on UML in current project.

    This generator assumes that vrayo_UML2python is used to generate
    python code from UML and assumes that generated ZIP file and 
    report are saved to some external service accessible via attachment
    url link variable (see below).
    
    Also you will need to create upwork_key.txt file with upwork public
    and private keys separated by a whitespace.
    
    Example:
    $ cd job; ls -d
      ~/job/upwork_post_XXX.py # <-- script generated by this file
      ~/job/upwork_key.txt # <-- public and private key file
    $ sudo pip install python-upwork
    $ python ./upwork_post_XXX.py

    
    How it works
    ============
    
    Each package is a separate upwork job.
    
    Jobs are generated only for packages that have 'jobtitle' and 'budget'
    custom properties defined. Those set job title and budget in USD 
    respectively.
    
    'skills' custom property is used to set the skills required, in 'debian-os' 
    notation.
    
    TODO
    ====
    
    - schedule to post at certain time, at which it is more likely to 
      get good offerings (morning in India, morning in Ukraine, US)
    - validate the skills and category values against metadata before 
      executing a request
